We took advantage of Information Retrieval methods to gain useful information out of raw requirements.

The dataset includes forty seven requirements which are the corresponding user stories. First, we calculated the term frequency-inverse document frequency values of all existed terms in requirements for all user stories. In the same way, we removed stop words and applied a stemming algorithm to obtain the root of our English terms, using Porterâ€™s algorithm [See refrence in Report.pdf].
