# Clustering-RIM
Very few works concentrated on adaptation of automated techniques for interactions management. This paper introduces a method for generally analyzing the requirements interaction of a library system using clustering. The purpose of proposed system is to improve the interactions between requirements through requirements clustering. 

We propose a method for making requirements interaction management automatic. To do so, we took advantage of information retrieval methods to gain useful information out of raw requirements which was accordingly used by clustering methods to find the structure of interactions between requirements. The results show that our approach can deliver stable clusters of requirements that interact similarly.
